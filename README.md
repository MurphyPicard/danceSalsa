I built this website for my brother Manolo.  He is a professional Salsa
dancer and loves to teach people how to move and express themselves.  If you
want to change your life, learn how to Salsa!

This site was made with HTML, CSS and AngularJS.  I mostly used Angular to
connect to the backend, post student info to the database and send out the
automatic emails to the hopeful students.

The code for the backend can be found here:

Challenges:

The two most challenging aspects to this project were designing the site exactly
the way my brother wanted it and getting the emails to send properly while his
password remained hidden.
